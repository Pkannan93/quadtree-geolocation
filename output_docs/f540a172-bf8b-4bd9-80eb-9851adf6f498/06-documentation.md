# Functional Specification

Web application

## Executive Summary
Web application

Repository: C:\Users\KANNAN~1.PUN\AppData\Local\Temp\a2a-repo-Bts6sm
Generated from repository analysis using static code patterns and inferred semantics.

## Actors
No explicit actor evidence found.

## Business Capabilities
- Base Object Operations
- Canvas Panel Operations
- Content Management
- Drawable Quad Operations
- Neighbour Impl Operations
- Quad Tree Operations
- Screen Operations

## Functional Workflows
### Base Object Operations
A user initiates base object operations activity. The system validates input and access context, executes business logic, and returns a user-facing outcome.

### Canvas Panel Operations
A user initiates canvas panel operations activity. The system validates input and access context, executes business logic, and returns a user-facing outcome.

### Content Management
A user initiates content management activity. The system validates input and access context, executes business logic, and returns a user-facing outcome.

### Drawable Quad Operations
A user initiates drawable quad operations activity. The system validates input and access context, executes business logic, and returns a user-facing outcome.

### Neighbour Impl Operations
A user initiates neighbour impl operations activity. The system validates input and access context, executes business logic, and returns a user-facing outcome.

### Quad Tree Operations
A user initiates quad tree operations activity. The system validates input and access context, executes business logic, and returns a user-facing outcome.


## Business Rules
- Business rules could not be fully inferred from static analysis; runtime validation and documentation review are recommended.

## System Interactions
The platform coordinates user-facing features through API and component layers. Inferred interaction patterns follow standard web application design with frontend-to-service communication.

## Assumptions and Open Questions
- Static analysis infers intent from naming patterns and structural evidence; runtime behavior may differ.
- Some routes or API-like constructs may originate from frontend navigation rather than backend services.
- Actor roles are inferred from evidence and may not capture all possible system users.
- Business capabilities are derived from keywords and patterns; manual review is recommended to validate domain accuracy.
- The precise business domain is unclear from analysis; consider manual review to confirm system purpose.
